# NumType

## Universal

*Definition from de [UD website](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/NumType.html)*

Some languages (especially Slavic) have a complex system of numerals. For example, in the school grammar of Czech, the main part of speech is “numeral”, it includes almost everything where counting is involved and there are various subtypes. It also includes interrogative, relative, indefinite and demonstrative words referring to numbers (words like kolik / how many, tolik / so many, několik / some, a few), so at the same time we may have a non-empty value of PronType. (In English, these words are called quantifiers and they are considered a subgroup of determiners.)

From the syntactic point of view, some numtypes behave like adjectives and some behave like adverbs. We tag them ADJ and ADV respectively. Thus the NumType feature applies to several different parts of speech:
- NUM: cardinal numerals
- DET: quantifiers
- ADJ: definite adjectival, e.g. ordinal numerals
- ADV: adverbial (e.g. ordinal and multiplicative) numerals, both definite and pronominal
