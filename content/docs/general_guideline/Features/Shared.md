# Shared
Left dependents on coordination are attached to the head of the coordination. Since the head of a coordination is the head of the leftmost conjunct, it is not possible to distinguish these dependents from the own dependents of the leftmost conjunct.

Right dependents on a coordination are attached to the head of the rightmost conjunct, but they can be confused with the own dependents of this conjunct.

As a consequence, left and right dependents on a coordination are marked with feature `Shared=Yes`, which distinguishes them from the own dependents of the respective leftmost and rightmost conjuncts.
