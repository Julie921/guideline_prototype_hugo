# Macrosyntax relations

In this part we will present relations that we use to analyse relations beyond the microsyntactic analysis between a governor and its dependant.

We call this type of analysis `macrosyntax`.

This approach can be used to analyse two elements that are placed side by side with no explicit marker of coordination, subordination, or argument relation with the head word. Ex: *I told him don't do it.* in this sentence we miss the usual marker *that*. Or in the following sentence: *My brother's children, you know he has two daughters, will come to visit* the part *you know he has two daughters* is inserted in the main sentence.

  

This phenomenon is frequent in languages and especially in oral speech. We gather these cases under the `parataxis` relation.

  

We distinguish:

   * [`parataxis:parenth`](../parataxis_parenth) for parenthetical clauses (that can form independent sentences)

   * [`parataxis:insert`](../parataxis_insert) for inserted clauses (that cannot form an independent sentence)

   * [`parataxis:obj`](../parataxis_obj) used before for attaching direct discourse. Now deleted.

  

However, there are three other cases that are not gathered under the `parataxis` relationship. The following three relations link elements to the main proposition on a macrosyntactic level. In some cases, these elements can be propositions, but also simple elements.

   * [`dislocated`](../dislocated)

   * [`vocative`](../vocative)

   * [`discourse`](../discourse)
