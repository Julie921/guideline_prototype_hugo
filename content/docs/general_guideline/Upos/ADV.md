# ADVERBE

## Universal

*Definition from [UD website](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/ADV.html)*

Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify adjectives and other adverbs, as in very briefly or arguably wrong.

There is a closed subclass of pronominal adverbs that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the ADV part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

Note that in Germanic languages, some adverbs may also function as verbal particles, as in write down or end up. They are still tagged ADV and not PART.

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in some languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adverbs in our universal tagging scheme. In particular, adverbial ordinal numerals ([cs] poprvé “for the first time”) and multiplicative numerals (e.g. once, twice) behave syntactically as adverbs and are tagged ADV.

Note that there are verb forms such as transgressives or adverbial participles that share properties and usage of adverbs and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or ADV.
Examples
- very
- well
- exactly
- tomorrow
- up, down
- interrogative/relative adverbs: where, when, how, why, whenever, wherever (including when used to mark a clause that is circumstantial, not interrogative or relative)
- demonstrative adverbs: here, there, now, then
- indefinite adverbs: somewhere, sometime, anywhere, anytime
- totality adverbs: everywhere, always
- negative adverbs: nowhere, never
- [de] usw. “etc.” (see conj)
