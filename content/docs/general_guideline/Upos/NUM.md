# Numeral  

## Universal  

*Definition from de [UD website](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/NUM.html)*

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by NUM whether they are used as determiners or not (as in Windows Seven) and whether they are expressed as words (four), digits (4) or Roman numerals (IV). Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers such as many and few) are tagged DET.

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in some languages (e.g. Czech) but which are not tagged NUM. Such non-cardinal numerals belong to other parts of speech in our universal tagging scheme, based mainly on syntactic criteria: ordinal numerals are adjectives (first, second, third) or adverbs ([cs] poprvé “for the first time”), multiplicative numerals are adverbs (once, twice) etc.

Word tokens consisting of digits and (optionally) punctuation characters are generally considered cardinal numbers and tagged as NUM. This includes numeric date/time formats (11:00) and phone numbers. Words mixing digits and alphabetic characters should, however, ordinarily be excluded. In English, for example, pluralized numbers (the 1970s, the seventies) are treated as plural NOUNs, while mixed alphanumeric street addresses (221B) and product names (130XE) are PROPN.
