#  Subordinating conjunction  

##   Universal  


*Definition from de [UD website](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/SCONJ.html)*

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause.

We follow Loos et al. 2003 in recognizing these three subclasses as subordinating conjunctions:

Complementizers, like [en] that or whether
Non-ADV markers that introduce an adverbial clause, like [en] because, since, before, or once (when introducing a clause, not a nominal)
Non-pronominal relativizers, like [he] še. Words in this category simply introduce a relative clause (and normally don’t inflect). This excludes words that have a nominal function within the relative clause; relative and resumptive pronouns (e.g., English relative that and which) are analyzed as PRON.
For coordinating conjunctions, see CCONJ.

Examples
- that as in I believe that he will come.
- if
- while
