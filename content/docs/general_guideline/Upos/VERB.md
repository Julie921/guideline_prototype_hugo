*Definition from de [UD website](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/VERB.html)*


A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause. Verbs are often associated with grammatical categories like tense, mood, aspect and voice, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.

Note that the VERB tag covers main verbs (content verbs) but it does not cover auxiliary verbs and verbal copulas (in the narrow sense), for which there is the AUX tag. Modal verbs may be considered VERB or AUX, depending on their behavior in the given language. Language-specific documentation should specify which verbs are tagged AUX in which contexts.

Note that participles are word forms that may share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or ADJ.

Note that some verb forms such as gerunds and infinitives may share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or NOUN.

Note that there are verb forms such as converbs (transgressives) or adverbial participles that share properties and usage of adverbs and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or ADV.

Deverbal connectives acting as adpositions or subordinators may be tagged VERB while participating in a case or mark relation: see ADP.
