##  Universal  

*Definition from de [UD website](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/X.html)*

The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. It should be used very restrictively.

A special usage of X is for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation flat:foreign is typically used in the syntactic analysis). This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal part-of-speech. For example, in he put on a large sombrero, sombrero is an ordinary NOUN.

Examples
- And then he just ***xfgh pdl jklw*** (keyboard smash)
