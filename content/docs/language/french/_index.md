# Overview of French Guidelines

Here you can find the guide to annotate somes constructions in French that we have to discuss about. Theses guidelines make it easier to annote and to understand our choice. 

You can ask your question, make request and suggestion on the [github](https://github.com/surfacesyntacticud/guidelines/issues) issue of the guideline, specifying it by a label.
