In Beja, verbal and nominal coordination are expressed with different enclitic morphemes. The texts  
contain 20 tokens of the verbal coordinating conjunction =t (and its allomorphs =it and =ajt) (Figure  
13). For half of the tokens, the conjunctions occur at the end of a prosodic unit, be it a major or a minor  
prosodic break, or a sentence. For this reason, we attach the coordinating conjunctions to the first  
conjunct and we consider that the second conjunct is the head of the coordination. See Kanayama et al.  
(2018) for a similar analysis in two other head-final languages, Japanese and Korean. As the conj relation  
is forbidden from right to left in UD, we introduced a dep:conj relation
